# Todo

1. **Objects having member functions.**
```kin
reka obj = {
    function: porogaramu_ntoya () {
        # some statements
    }
}
```

Even though these functionalities can be achieved by nesting functions, in Kin you can do:
```kin
foo.bar()
```
if inside foo function we have bar function.
