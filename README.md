## Description

**Kin** is a straightforward programming language created with the purpose of aiding Kinyarwanda speakers in easily learning programming.

> [!Important]
> **Kin** is designed to enable individuals to write computer programs in Kinyarwanda, the native language of Rwandans. The aim is to facilitate an easy introduction to programming for people. While it is well-suited for teaching or learning programming, its suitability for use in a production environment is not guaranteed.

## What does it look like

> Bubble sort algorithm implementation ðŸ˜Ž

## Hello \<name\> !

```Kin
reka name = injiza_amakuru("Enter your name: ")
tangaza_amakuru("Hello ", name, "!")
```
> Get name from console and greet you!

## Fun fact!

In Kin, multiple statements can be written on the same line ðŸ˜‚

### This will work
```Kin
reka name = injiza_amakuru("Enter your name: ") tangaza_amakuru("Hello ", name, "!")
```

### Also this will work
```Kin
tangaza_amakuru("Hello ", injiza_amakuru("Enter your name: "), "!")
```
